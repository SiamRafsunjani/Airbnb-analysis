Name of the city, checkin checkout and number of guest. User fills in these 3 information and a number of listings is shown. \n","\n","So host ranking is a very important part of their success. Ranking is a very interesting problem and can get very complex over time. So it is better to start off small and improve the ranking algorithm phase by phase.\n","\n","Firstly we should check of features that we think might persuade a user to rent a listing. For example listings with bookings more than 1000 will rank higher, higher average review rating will rank higher, listings with lower prices will rank higher. We will deploy this model into production and keep user engagement to this ranked data in the database. Update the model periodicly and at the same time store user interaction data. We can use A/B testing to show different users different listings suggested by different model. This data will enable us to create user personalised model and at the same time tune for other parameters which cannot be handcrafted from experience.\n","\n","Next phase can be to improve our ranking algorithm from real user data. We can store per booking information and review ratings related to that to improve our model even further. Features such as booked home location and user location, trip dates, trip length, number of guests, price , type of trip: family, business, clicks on listings, first trip or returning to location,  Domestic / International trip, Lead days, review, ratings, user location.  \n","\n","We can use language processing to build word cloud from user review data, sentiment analysis and prioritise model toward what user want regionally.
